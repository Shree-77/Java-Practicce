/**
 * Create a class called Complex for performing arithmetic with complex numbers. Complex numbers
 *    have the form realPart + imaginaryPart * i; where i is the imaginary unit.
 *    Write a program to test your class. Use floating-point variables to represent the private data of the class.
 *    Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when itâ€™s declared. Provide a
 *    no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide public methods
 *    that perform the following operations:
 *    a) Add two Complex numbers: The real parts are added together and the imaginary parts are added
 *    together.
 *    b) Subtract two Complex numbers: The real part of the right operand is subtracted from the real part of
 *    the left operand, and the imaginary part of the right operand is subtracted from the imaginary part of
 *    the left operand.
 *    c) Print Complex numbers in the form (realPart, imaginaryPart)
