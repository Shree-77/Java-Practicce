1. Write an application that inputs a line of text and tokenizes the line using space character as delimiter
   and outputs the tokens in reverse order.

2. Write an application that inputs a telephone number as a string in the form (555) 555-5555. The application should extract
  the area code (the first three digits of the phone number) as a token, and the last four digits of the phone number as a token.
  The seven digits (the first three digits and the last four digits) of the phone number should be concatenated into one string and
  be printed.

3  Write an application involving switch-case-default that performs one of the following actions:
   (i) reads a line of text and outputs the text twiceâ€”once in all uppercase letters and once in all lowercase
   letters;
   (ii) reads a line of text and a search character and uses String method indexOf to determine the number
   of occurrences of the character in the text;
   (iii) reads a line of text, tokenizes the line using space characters as delimiters and outputs only those
   words beginning with the letter "b";
   (iv) reads a line of text, tokenizes it using space characters as delimiters and outputs only those words
   ending with the letters "ED".
   (v) reads a line of text, tokenizes the line with String method split and outputs the tokens in reverse
   order. Use space characters as delimiters.
