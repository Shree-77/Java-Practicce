1. Develop and test a program that creates three tasks and three threads to run them.
(i) The first task prints the letter a 100 times.
(ii) The second task prints the letter b 100 times.
(iii) The third task prints the integers 1 through 100.
2. Define a class that implements the Runnable interface using the following specifications. The run
method should loop ten times through the following task actions of printing a time stamp, followed by a
greeting and then wait for a second.
3. Develop and test a multithreaded program one of which should generate and display Fibonacci
numbers and the other should compute factorial of a number. The first thread should be suspended for
two seconds after printing every ten numbers.
4. Develop a multi-threaded program involving three threads one of which prints the message Hello World for one hundred     times, the second thread prints a user-specified substring from a user input string and the third thread generates one  hundred random numbers and computes its sum and displays it. The program execution should start with the first thread. The   second thread should wait until the first thread finishes and the third thread should wait for the second thread to finish. The three threads should execute in a loop for a user specified number of times.
