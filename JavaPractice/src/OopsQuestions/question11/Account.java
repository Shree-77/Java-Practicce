/**
 * Write down a high-level abstraction of the following specification on the
 * answer sheet; implement and test it.
 * Consider a class Account to represent a bank account owned by a customer
 * (account holder).
 * An account is characterized by the private instance fields â€“ an
 * account number (type String), the account balance (type double)
 * and the name of the account holder (type String). The Account
 * class should have a constructor that initializes the instance
 * fields. Provide a set and a get method for each instance field.
 * In addition, provide the deposit and withdrawal method and a
 * method named computeInterest that calculates the interest earned
 * by an account if the interest rate is 6% per annum. Test the
 * class using the main method showing the invocation of deposit,
 * withdrawal and computeInterest method.
