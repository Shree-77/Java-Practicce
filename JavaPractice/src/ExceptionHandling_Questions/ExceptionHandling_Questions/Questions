1. Write a program that asks the user to input a set of floating-point values. When the user enters a value that is not a number,
  give the user two more chances to enter the value.After three chances, quit reading input. Add all correctly specified values
  and print the sum when the user is done entering data. Use exception handling to detect improper inputs.

2. Develop a class called Student containing registration number, name and total credits registered by a student.Read studentsâ€™ information through
   keyboard. Develop a user-defined exception called CreditsOutOfRange to throw exception whenever the total number of credits registered by a student
    is either less than 16 or greater than 24 and an exception called NameCaseException should also be thrown if the name of a student is not entered
    in upper case letters. Show the usage of these exceptions in try-catch-finally block and in throws clause.
